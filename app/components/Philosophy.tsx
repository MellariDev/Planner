            At the heart of our rural Kentucky kitchen lies a simple truth: every cake tells a story.
            We believe in the power of tradition, the beauty of craftsmanship, and the joy that comes
            from sharing something made with care.
          </p>
          <p className="philosophy-text">
            Our ingredients are sourced with intention, our techniques passed down through generations,
            and our commitment to quality unwavering. Each creation is a celebration of flavor, texture,
            and the moments that bring us together.
          </p>
          <p className="philosophy-text">
            Whether it's a wedding cake that marks a new beginning, a birthday cake that honors another
            year, or a simple dessert that makes an ordinary day special, we pour our passion into every
            layer, every swirl, every detail.
